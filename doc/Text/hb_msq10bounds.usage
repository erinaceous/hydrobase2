hb_msq10bounds
 Accepts a 10-deg MSq and (optional) increment as arguments and
returns bounds in the proper format: w/e/s/n  .  Specifying
an increment will enlarge the bounds by half the increment
-- useful to generate node-grids as opposed to pixel-grids.

Usage:  hb_msq10bounds msq_10 [-I<incr> 

 msq_10 is the 4-digit WMO (Marsden Square).
 
  OPTIONS:
[-I]  : specifies grid increment.
        Bounds will be offset by half the increment.
[-h]  : help -- prints this message.
