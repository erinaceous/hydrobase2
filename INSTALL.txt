Hydrobase needs NetCDF 3.6.3.  Since I use both
Netcdf 3.6.3 and NetCDF 4+, I've put my netcdf 3.6.3
installation in /usr/local/netcdf3, but that can be
changed at the top of ./src/makefile.

Similarly, since both Hydrobase2 and Hydrobase3 are
useful to have on the same machine at the same time,
I use these install directories:
/usr/local/hb2/bin
/usr/local/hb3/bin
which can be changed in the makefile.  Some of the
scripts use these directories to call to HB2 or HB3
functions, so be careful if you choose a different
install path.  These directories should be created
before attempting to install HB2 or HB3.
